    "Counter is a powerful tool for counting, validating, and learning more about the elements within a dataset that is found in the collections module. You pass an iterable (list, set, tuple) or a dictionary to the Counter. You can also use the Counter object similarly to a dictionary with key/value assignment, for example counter[key] = value.\n",

    "A common usage for Counter is checking data for consistency prior to using it, so let's do just that. In this exercise, you'll be using data from the Chicago Transit Authority on ridership."
